# YOLOX

Nanodet: YOLOX is an anchor-free version of YOLO, with a simpler design but better performance! It aims to bridge the gap between research and industrial communities. YOLOX is a high-performing object detector, an improvement to the existing YOLO series. YOLO series are in constant exploration of techniques to improve the object detection techniques for optimal speed and accuracy trade-off for real-time applications.

Key features of the YOLOX object detector
- **Anchor-free detectors** significantly reduce the number of design parameters
- **A decoupled head for classification, regression, and localization** improves the convergence speed
- **SimOTA advanced label assignment strategy** reduces training time and avoids additional solver hyperparameters
- **Strong data augmentations like MixUp and Mosiac** to boost YOLOX performance

Note:
- This version of YoloX: YoloX_s

## Demo

### Python

Run the following command to try the demo: 
```shell
# detect on camera input
python demo.py
# detect on an image
python demo.py --input /path/to/image -v
```
Note: 
- image result saved as "result.jpg"
- this model requires `opencv-python>=4.8.0`

### C++

Install latest OpenCV and CMake >= 3.24.0 to get started with:

```shell
# A typical and default installation path of OpenCV is /usr/local
cmake -B build -D OPENCV_INSTALLATION_PATH=/path/to/opencv/installation .
cmake --build build

# detect on camera input
./build/opencv_zoo_object_detection_yolox
# detect on an image
./build/opencv_zoo_object_detection_yolox -m=/path/to/model -i=/path/to/image -v
# get help messages
./build/opencv_zoo_object_detection_yolox -h
```
