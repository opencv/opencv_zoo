# Hand pose estimation from MediaPipe Handpose

This model estimates 21 hand keypoints per detected hand from [palm detector](../palm_detection_mediapipe). (The image below is referenced from [MediaPipe Hands Keypoints](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/hand-pose-detection#mediapipe-hands-keypoints-used-in-mediapipe-hands))

This model is converted from TFlite to ONNX using following tools:
- TFLite model to ONNX: https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx
- simplified by [onnx-simplifier](https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier)

**Note**:
- The int8-quantized model may produce invalid results due to a significant drop of accuracy.
- Visit https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/models.md#hands for models of larger scale.

## Demo

Run the following commands to try the demo:
```bash
# detect on camera input
python demo.py
# detect on an image
python demo.py -i /path/to/image -v
```
