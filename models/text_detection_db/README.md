Real-time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization

Note:
- Models source: [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qzNCHfUJOS0NEUOIKn69eCtxdlNPpWbq).
- `IC15` in the filename means the model is trained on [IC15 dataset](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=introduction), which can detect English text instances only.
- `TD500` in the filename means the model is trained on [TD500 dataset](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php/MSRA_Text_Detection_500_Database_(MSRA-TD500)), which can detect both English & Chinese instances.
