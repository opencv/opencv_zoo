# Nanodet

Nanodet: NanoDet is a FCOS-style one-stage anchor-free object detection model which using Generalized Focal Loss as classification and regression loss.In NanoDet-Plus, we propose a novel label assignment strategy with a simple assign guidance module (AGM) and a dynamic soft label assigner (DSLA) to solve the optimal label assignment problem in lightweight model training.

Note:
- This version of nanodet: Nanodet-m-plus-1.5x_416

## Demo

Run the following command to try the demo: 
```shell
# detect on camera input
