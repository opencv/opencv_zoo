# WeChatQRCode

WeChatQRCode for detecting and parsing QR Code, contributed by [WeChat Computer Vision Team (WeChatCV)](https://github.com/WeChatCV). Visit [opencv/opencv_contrib/modules/wechat_qrcode](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/wechat_qrcode) for more details.

Notes:
- Model source: [opencv/opencv_3rdparty:wechat_qrcode_20210119](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/tree/wechat_qrcode_20210119)
- The APIs `cv::wechat_qrcode::WeChatQRCode` (C++) & `cv.wechat_qrcode_WeChatQRCode` (Python) are both designed to run on default backend (OpenCV) and target (CPU) only. Therefore, benchmark results of this model are only available on CPU devices, until the APIs are updated with setting backends and targets.

## Demo

Run the following command to try the demo:
```shell
# detect on camera input
