# YuNet

YuNet is a light-weight, fast and accurate face detection model, which achieves 0.834(AP_easy), 0.824(AP_medium), 0.708(AP_hard) on the WIDER Face validation set.

Notes:

- Model source: [here](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection.train/blob/a61a428929148171b488f024b5d6774f93cdbc13/tasks/task1/onnx/yunet.onnx).
- This model can detect **faces of pixels between around 10x10 to 300x300** due to the training scheme.
- For details on training this model, please visit https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection.train.
- This ONNX model has fixed input shape, but OpenCV DNN infers on the exact shape of input image. See https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/issues/44 for more information.
